# Pygame educational mini games
## What is it?
*PEMG* is a **mini games  collection** which aims at training your python skills and knowledge.
In **each one of these games**, you will have to **prove** that you **know** things in order to get a better score.

## How to install it?
**Easy!** Our collection only runs on **four dependencies**, which can easily be installed by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

## Pygame? Educational?? Mini games???
### Why pygame?
We wanted to code our game in **python**. After all, this is the language on which we need to improve. *Pygame* just felt **obvious**, and some members had already worked with it.
Of course, we know that python is **clearly** not meant for gamedev, but it was an easy way into it.

### Why educational?
There is a reason why all of our mini games' themes revolves around python: **This a school project**.
A constraint we had (pretty much the only one) was **to make a game that included python** (in the gameplay), so that's what we did!
In addition to that, most players will also be **students** (learning python). So yeah, kill two birds with one stone.

### Why mini games?
Very quickly in the project (the first day actually), we realized that having **6 people who don't really know pygame** (or gamedev at all) on the same game would lead to **a disaster**. So we decided, in order to keep the game's quality (and our minds' sanity), to **split** that into duos and solos. Each of them working on some part of the collection.

## Let's talk about the games.

### The menu

The idea was to have a "game" as a menu in which you could launch **every game** by going into a certain zone.

In each round of this game, you have to get **the good piece of code** between three choices.
The game alternate between two phases:
- **which_is_python**: In this phase, you have to touch the code which you think **is python** (others are incorrect or from another language)
- **which_is_good**: In this mode, a code line will appear down your screen. You must touch what she would get back.
